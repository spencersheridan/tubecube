HTML and CSS for an animated cube of YouTube videos

This is just a test of using some CSS3 3D transforms on embedded YouTube videos or iframes. Surprisingly there aren't many tehnical hurdles here - the browser doesn't mind applying 3d transforms to the iframe.

The most annoying thing is that the videos won't autoplay on mobile browsers.
